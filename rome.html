                        She was goddess of agriculture, grain, women, motherhood and marriage; and the lawgiver.

                        It was suggested that the cycle of seasons coincided with Ceres’ mood. The months of winter were
                        the period in which her daughter, Proserpina, was obligated to live in the underworld with
                        Pluto, having eaten pomegranate, the fruit of the underworld.

                        Ceres’ happiness at her daughters return allowed plants to grow through spring and summer, but
                        in autumn she began to dread her daughter’s absence, and plants shed their crop.

                        Mercury was a roman psychopomp, tasked with guiding the souls of the dead to the underworld.

                        In some mythology Vulcan is said to have been banished from the heavens as a child because of a
                        physical defect. Hidden in the base of a volcano he learnt his trade.

                        the volcano became volatile.

                        Because of his position as deity of destructive fire, Vulcan’s temples were regularly located

                        <p> In ancient Roman religion and myth, Faunus was the horned god of the forest,
                            plains and fields; when he made cattle fertile he was called Inuus. He came to be equated in
                            literature with the Greek god <a href="greek.html#Pan">Pan</a></p>

                            Parcae are the Roman personifications of humankind's and the gods' destinies, commonly
                            referred to as the Fates of Roman mythology. They are the Roman equivalents to the Greek
                            Moirai. The names of the three Parcae are Nona (Greek equivalent Clotho), Decima (Greek
                            equivalent Lachesis) and Morta (Greek equivalent Atropos)

                        <p>
                            The Muses were the Greek/Roman goddesses of poetic inspiration, the adored deities of song,
                            dance, and memory, on whose mercy the creativity, wisdom and insight of all artists and
                            thinkers depended. They may have been originally three in number, but, according to Hesiod
                            and the prevailing tradition he established, most commonly they are depicted as the nine
                            daughters of <a href="greek.html#Zeus">Zeus</a> and Mnemosyne</p>

                            Enter each item on a new line, choose the amount of groups unders settings, and click the button to generate
                            your randomized list. Don't like the first team? Just click again until you do.
                
                            Fairly pick teams without bias. No need to draw names out of a hat. No need to do a grade school style draft
                            or put hours of thought into the most balanced teams. The most fair dividing method possible is random.
                
                            Mix up your to-do list by generating random groups out of them. For example, enter all your housecleaning
                            activities and split them into seven groups, one for each day or one for each person.</p>
